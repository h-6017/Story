It was a cold day in
November. I had been awake
for more than forty-eight hours.
As I stopped at the gas
station for a pack of smokes
and a red bull, my eyes
began to close of their own
accord. No matter how hard I
Concentrated, sleep was an ever present
weight in my mind. The red
bull helped a little, but the
cigarette was better. I was only
a few minutes late for my
shift at the night club, and
no one noticed me as I
set up the entrance to the 
establishment. I rubbed at my eyes,
trying to scrub the fatigue away
with the palms of my hands.
The owner of the club, Thanos,
arrived to give me the rundown
of the event, a gogo dancer
competition. He also dropped off a
set of colored armbands and a
guest list. I checked with the
ladies at the cash registers and
ensured that they were ready. I
could hear the crowd, eager and
impatient, waiting for the door to
unlock. The next several hours were
a blur. The earbud on my
radio buzzed with chatter. Ice to
bar one, security to the VIP
lounge, updates on the competition. I
checked Ids, managed the radio traffic,
and delt with pr and security
problems. Sleep was steadily creeping into
the basic processes in my brain.
Words began to make less sense,
my body reacted to my commands
more and more slowly. But the
night ended, and the customers went
home. All I had to do
was get the cleaning done and
I would be free to find 
my bed. I left my radio
on and began to mop the
main dance floor, roboticly forcing myself
to go through the motions. Suddenly
the radio exploded in shouts and chaos,
I saw my manager drop his
broom and bolt for the exit.
I followed as adrenaline dumped into
my system. My mind grew sharp
and my body snapped under my
control. We exited the bar and
followed the sounds of shouting across
the street. I saw a fight,
friend and foe circling and attacking.
The first person who came near
me was not a member of
the security staff, so I restrained
him and tried to pull him
away from the fray. But before
I had regained my feet I
felt my body rock forward and
everything went black.
